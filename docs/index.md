# About MasonSWE

MasonSWE is the Software Engineering (SE) group in the Computer Science department at [George Mason](https://www.gmu.edu) University! We are interested in all aspects of SE research, including program analysis, software testing, programming languages, logic, security, AI/ML, HCI.

- Our [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=lEa2_icAAAAJ) profile and publication page.
- Although our group is relatively small (6 faculty), with many working in areas beyond SE (such as HCI, Logic, and Programming Languages), we are highly active in the SE research community and regularly publish in leading SE conferences and journals. According to [CSRanking](http://csrankings.org/#/index?soft&us), MasonSWE is in the top 10 in Software Engineering in the US for the past 10+ years (currently #9 as of March 2025).
